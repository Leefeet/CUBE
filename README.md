# CUBE
A small JavaScript 2D Platformer game I created between break times at work.

You can play the actual game by visiting it here: <https://www.leethibodeau.com/cube>

Most, if not all, pushes and updates to this repository will not be dated properly. This is because I'm doing all my editing through P5.JS's web editor. This allows me to access my code from any device as long as I log in, but I'm not able to easily update my changes with GitHub since I'm using a foreign computer. So, I've made a new version every time I add some code/features and make notes of what was changed. I will then push them to this GitHub repository notating what changes were made, along with the date they were made (days only, not time). This will simulate almost exactly the changes I made over time.

The very first version of this project was created February 4, 2021

P5.JS is a JavaScript library that adds a lot of useful functions for the canvas HTML element, making drawing to the screen easy (visit <https://p5js.org/> for more info). 

I like Platformers, so I wanted to create a small project that would allow me to start developing some platformer concepts from a programming standpoint. The game looks simple, but it plays well. I had a great time implementing the game system, such as AABB collision, player movement, and pausing.

The game is still in development whenever I get around to coding more of it. It all depends on whether I have some break time during work. At least 99% of this code was written during breaks, and I want to keep it that way.
